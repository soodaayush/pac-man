## Inspiration

I wanted to dive into game development on the web and figured Pac Man would be a fun and manageable starting point. Itâ€™s iconic, engaging, and packed with great learning opportunities, which is perfect for a beginner project.

## Challenges

- Programming character logic (Pac-Man and ghosts)
- Handling grid-based movement and collisions
- Defining game boundaries and map layout
- Managing game states like win/loss conditions

## Lessons Learned

- JavaScript Classes: I used JS classes to organize characters and their behavior, which taught me how to structure code more cleanly and reuse functionality.
- Parcel Bundler: I learned how to use Parcel to bundle, serve, and deploy modern web apps with minimal configuration.
- Game Loops & Input Handling: I explored how to manage keyboard events and game loops in JavaScript.

## The Website

This is a classic Pac-Man game recreated using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can control Pac-Man using the arrow keys. The game runs entirely in the browser and is bundled with Parcel.
