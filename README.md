## Inspiration

I wanted to learn about making simple games in a website so I decided Pac Man would be the best for a starter project.

## Challenges

Programming the functionality behind characters, movements, game borders, etc.

## Lessons Learned

I learned the fundamentals of JavaScript classes through the character files and how using them creates better organization. I also learned about using Parcel to build websites.

## The Website

This is the Pac Man game on a website. You can control Pac Man through arrow keys.
