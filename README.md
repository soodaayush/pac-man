![pac-man](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2e277e3-f9e8-439d-96bc-f31901f12150)

## Inspiration

I wanted to learn about making simple games in a website so I decided Pac Man will be the best one to build.

## Challenges

Programming the functionality behind characters, movements, the game borders, etc.

## Lessons Learned

I learned the fundamentals of JavaScript classes through the character files and how using them creates better organization. I also learned about using Parcel to build websites.

## The Website

This is the Pac Man game on a website. You can control the character through arrow keys.
